# IO18WatchFace
This is a simple animated watch face for Wear OS inspired by the countdown timer animation on the Google I/O app and website.

The animation uses Airbnb's [Lottie](http://airbnb.io/lottie/), which is a pretty impressive tool - but which strains the capabilities of 2016-era Wear hardware. I wish we had 2018-era Wear hardware to run it on, but alas, [none is available](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/02/android-wear-is-getting-killed-and-its-all-qualcomms-fault/).

All graphics in the app are extracted from the I/O app or website, and presumably are Â© Google Inc.
