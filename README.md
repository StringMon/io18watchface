# IO18WatchFace
This is a simple animated watch face for Wear OS inspired by the countdown timer animation on the Google I/O app and website.

The animation uses Lottie, http://airbnb.io/lottie/, which is a pretty impressive tool - but which strains the capabilities of 2016-era Wear hardware.

All graphics in the app are extracted from the I/O app or website, and presumably are Â© Google Inc.
